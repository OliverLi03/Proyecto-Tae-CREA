				<h1><strong>The Big World of "PC Gaming"</strong></h1>

			<h3>Basic Knowledge</h3>
			<p class="fs-5">To begin with, two notions should be distinguished: software, which is the logical or intangible part of a computer, such as operating systems, programs and applications, which is what makes the rest work, and hardware, which is the tangible part of the PC, that which can be seen and touched, both its internal components (which are inside the cabinet, the metal housing) and its external devices (which are outside the cabinet). However, the software and hardware complement each other, since the absence of any of them makes the operation of the computer impossible.
			For the use of the PC it is important to have in addition a monitor, a keyboard and a mouse or mouse. And today, the need for cameras, microphones, speakers and headphones has increased. These are external devices, called external peripherals, because they connect to the computer without being part of it. 
			Peripherals are classified according to the flow of information, that is, the type of exchange. There are then internal and external peripherals, which in turn can be input, output or mixed (depending on whether they perform input, output or input and output functions).</p>

			<h3>What do you need to build a PC?</h3>
			<p class="fs-5">To assemble a desktop computer, you need several components. Some are essential for operation: cabinet, power supply, motherboard, RAM, mechanical or solid state hard disk, microprocessor, CPU cooler, connectors, cables and ports. Others, although not essential, should be known and, depending on the use given to the PC, can be very important: video plate, network plate, CD/DVD/Blu-ray recorder/reader, fan cooler and sound card.
			In addition to components, ports (which is the name given to an interface through which different types of data can be sent and received) and connectors are essential. A connector is an interface used to connect wired devices: there are males, with protruding pins to insert, and females or sockets, where those pins are inserted. The connectors allow to link, assemble and disassemble the different parts.</p>

			<h3>What is the purpose of each component?</h3>
			<h4>The Motherboard</h4>
			<p class="fs-5">It is the main component of the central unit. It centralizes and processes the data exchanged within the computer using the processor. Handles hard drive, keyboard, mouse, network, USB ports...
			It is the support in which all the components of a computer are connected.
			The motherboard is a circuit in which the chipset is connected (set of components that provide control of almost the entire motherboard . The components of the chipset are directly welded to the motherboard and dictate the specifics of the processors and the memories that can be installed. Since 1995, almost all motherboards have ATX format.</p>
			<div class="imgs d-flex justify-content-center">

			</div>
			<h4>CPU</h4>
			<p class="fs-5">The processor or CPU (Central Processing Unit) is the brain of the computer. It handles the exchange of data between components (RAM, hard disk, graphics card). The processor does the calculations allowing the user to interact with the computer and display the system on the screen. 
			Today, a processor can reach up to 5 Ghz and some computers are equipped with several processors.
			They can process billions of data per second and make big calculations that allow science and medicine to progress faster. Computer power is based on the processor.</p>
			<h4>Hard Disk</h4>
			<p class="fs-5">It role is to store computer data. The hard disk contains the operating system such as Windows, macOS or Linux (among others), the installed programs and the user s personal data.
			Stores information in binary form. Currently, they are able to store several Tera bytes of data (ie 1024 gigabytes), which corresponds to hundreds of thousands of photographs, thousands of movies, millions of text documents...
			There are several types of hard drives: Classic hard drives(they contain mechanical parts that include a read head that points to the magnetic disks and reads and writes the data), SSD hard drives(without a mechanical part, they read data faster) and external hard drives(to have a backup of the computer and its internal hard drive).</p>

			<h4>Power Source</h4>
			<p class="fs-5">Of course, without the electrical current, the computer won t work.
			This block transforms and supplies the necessary power to the motherboard, but it is also connected to some components, such as the DVD player/burner, for example.
			The transformation of the current causes a loss of energy in the form of heat, so the computer has a ventilation system that expels air through the back of the computer case.
			Generally, a capacity of 400 watts is sufficient, but some power supplies can reach 1000 watts.</p>
			<h4>RAM</h4>
			<p class="fs-5">The RAM (Random Access Memory) is used by the processor, which places the data there for processing.
			Memory ranges from 256 MB to 16 GB and should be chosen according to the processor, the capacity of the motherboard and the use one makes of the computer.</p>
			<div class="imgs d-flex justify-content-center">

			</div>
			<h4>Graphic Card</h4>
			<p class="fs-5">For games, it is important to have a good graphics card. It takes care of the display of the screen, freeing the processor of this function.
			It can also be replaced by the integrated chipset directly on the motherboard.</p>
			<h3>How I hope hadware will evolve</h3>
			<p class="fs-5">Overall, hardware is likely to continue to evolve towards improved speed, capacity and energy efficiency. Processors are expected to become more powerful and faster, and storage systems to become larger and faster.
			In addition, artificial intelligence and machine learning technology is expected to continue to evolve and improve, which could lead to specialized and highly efficient hardware for specific AI tasks.
			Other emerging trends in hardware technology include quantum computing, advanced robotics, and virtual and augmented reality. These technologies could have a significant impact on hardware evolution in the coming years.
			Overall, hardware evolution is likely to be driven by a combination of technological advances and market demands, and will remain an area of rapid development and change in the years to come.</p>
